# PROGRESS.md — Session-to-session state

> Read this first when resuming work in a new Claude Code session. Keep it current: milestone status, decisions,
> known bugs, measured results, and the exact next step.

## Current status

| Milestone | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** Architecture & feasibility | ✅ Documents delivered — **awaiting operator approval** | 2026-10-18 | PLAN.md, RESEARCH.md, ACCEPTANCE.md, provider registry draft, evidence |
| M1 Infrastructure & data collection | ⏸ not started (blocked on approval, PLAN §24 Q1) | — | |
| M2 Discovery & on-chain safety | ⏸ | — | effectively needs Q2 (free Jupiter key + keyed RPC) |
| M3 Features & strategy engine | ⏸ | — | |
| M4 AI judge | ⏸ | — | optional; needs Q4 |
| M5 Full PAPER trading | ⏸ | — | |
| M6 Statistical learning & confidence | ⏸ | — | |
| M7 Dashboard & operations | ⏸ | — | |
| M8 LIVE infrastructure | ⏸ | — | no real funds ever used in M8 |
| M9 Forward validation | ⏸ | — | ≥ 60 days calendar time |

**Mode of the system:** nothing runs yet. No code, no keys, no wallet.

## M0 acceptance results (2026-10-18)

| ID | Result |
|---|---|
| M0-01 | Delivered; pending operator review |
| M0-02 | All external facts in RESEARCH.md carry evidence tags |
| M0-03 | 20 sanitized evidence files in `research/evidence/2026-10-18/` (cookies stripped; secret-pattern scan: only a false positive inside a token's marketing text) |
| M0-04 | Questions batched in PLAN.md §24 |
| M0-05 | No implementation code written |

## Key measurements from M0 (details + evidence in RESEARCH.md)

- Jupiter quote round-trip cost on memecoins with $22k–$59k liquidity: **2.2%–4.1%** (0.1–1 SOL tickets).
- Jupiter platform fee: 10 bps/side on memecoins; 2 bps SOL→USDC (RFQ).
- GeckoTerminal: documented ~10 calls/min; measured ~50% 429s at ~35 attempted/min; 60 s cache.
- DexScreener: 300/min on pair/token endpoints, 30 addresses/call; `liquidity` absent on bonding-curve pairs.
- Public RPC: `getTokenLargestAccounts` 429 on 4/4 attempts (shared cloud IP — re-measure at home in M1).
- Public WS: pump.fun program logs ≈ 140–234 msg/s ≈ 19 GB/day.
- New pump.fun mints: Token-2022 with `metadataPointer` + `tokenMetadata` only.
- Token-account rent: 0.001488 SOL (165 B), 0.001514 SOL (170 B).
- SOL ≈ $101.8 at research time.

## Architectural decisions (proposed in M0; final once approved)

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D-01 | Four processes: engine, guardian, console, research (+ signer only in LIVE) | Failure-domain isolation; guardian owns all exits |
| D-02 | Three SQLite DBs: `market.db`, `ledger-paper.db` / `ledger-live.db`, `research.db` | Physical mode separation; small critical ledger backed up often |
| D-03 | Horizon 15 min–24 h; no sniping | Data cached 30–60 s; costs 2–4% |
| D-04 | DexScreener = refresh workhorse; GT = discovery + OHLCV; Jupiter = quotes + Tokens v2 + execution | Measured/documented limits |
| D-05 | Token-2022 extension allow-list (fail-closed) | pump.fun mints are Token-2022 |
| D-06 | `Observed[T]` wrapper; unknown never zero | Spec + DexScreener missing-field finding |
| D-07 | Pure decision core shared by SHADOW/PAPER/LIVE | Replay determinism; mode parity |
| D-08 | Conservative paper profile drives portfolio state | Avoid optimistic simulation |
| D-09 | Judge off by default; zero influence until validated | Spec + cost |
| D-10 | LIVE arming is CLI-only; dashboard can only disarm | Attack surface |
| D-11 | React + TS + Vite dashboard; UI built with Node or Docker; runtime Python-only | Polish + maintainability |
| D-12 | Internal package `desk`, brand only in UI (working brand KESTREL) | Brand can change freely |
| D-13 | Python 3.12 via `uv`, hash-locked | Matches operator's Mint 22.3; reproducible |
| D-14 | Address constants verified on-chain, never typed from memory | A memory-typed USDC mint was wrong during M0 |

## Known issues / open items
See RESEARCH.md §11 (R-01 … R-10) and PLAN.md §23 (risk register).

## Operator environment (from operator, 2026-10-18)
Linux Mint 22.3 (Ubuntu 24.04), Ryzen 7 7730U, 16 GB RAM (swap 83% used at report time, ~6 Docker containers),
~290 GB free NVMe, Wi-Fi only (RTL8821CE), laptop on battery/AC, Tailscale installed, 1920×1080 display.

## Next step
1. Operator reviews PLAN.md and answers PLAN.md §24 (Q1 is blocking; Q2 effectively blocking for M2).
2. On approval: start M1 — `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`, `src/desk/core`, `contracts`, `storage`, provider adapters
   seeded with the M0 fixtures, rate limiter, `desk doctor`. Then run M1 acceptance tests and report actual results here.

## Session log
- **2026-10-18 (session 1):** M0 research (live read-only probes of GeckoTerminal, DexScreener, Solana public RPC/WS,
  Jupiter v1/v2/Tokens/Shield; docs for Jupiter, Helius, Solana clusters, DexScreener, GeckoTerminal; Anthropic
  reference). Wrote PLAN.md, RESEARCH.md, ACCEPTANCE.md, PROGRESS.md, `research/provider_registry.yaml`, evidence.
  Incorporated operator's hardware report (PLAN §2, §18). Built a static visual concept
  (`docs/design/kestrel-concept.html`, sample data only); validated chart/text colours with the dataviz checker —
  muted text changed `#5F6D7D` → `#76869A` (contrast 3.6 → 5.1:1); brand neons restricted to identity use; series
  palette stepped into the dark band (worst adjacent CVD ΔE 7.9 ⇒ direct labels mandatory). Rendered at 1920×1080 and
  390 px: no console errors, no external requests, no horizontal page scroll. Stopped for approval.
